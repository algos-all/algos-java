# Package algos-java

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/all3fox/algos-java.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/all3fox/algos-java)

## What is algos-java?

The algos-java package contains implementations of some classic computer
science algorithms. My primary goal is to understand
those algorithms and the best way to do that is to code them myself.

Along the way I practice test driven development (with [testng][1]),
continuos integration (with [travis][2]), version control
(with [git][3] and [github][4]), and a lot more.
